The blockchain is a digital, decentralised, distributed ledger.

区块链是一个数字化、去中心化、分布式的账本。

Most explanations for the importance of the blockchain start with Bitcoin and the history of money. But money is just the first use case of the blockchain. And it is unlikely to be the most important.

对于区块链重要性的解释，大多数从比特币和货币史开始的。但货币只是区块链的第一个使用场景，而且还不太可能是最重要的使用场景。

It might seem strange that a ledger — a dull and practical document associated mainly with accounting — would be described as a revolutionary technology. But the blockchain matters because ledgers matter.

这看起来很奇怪，一份与会计有关的枯燥而实用的文件，将被描述为一种革命性的技术。但是区块链确实很重要，因为账本很重要。

### Ledgers all the way down    账本概览

Ledgers are everywhere. Ledgers do more than just record accounting transactions. A ledger consists simply of data structured by rules. Any time we need a consensus about facts, we use a ledger. Ledgers record the facts underpinning the modern economy.

账本无处不在。账本不仅仅是记录会计交易。一个账本包含着按规则组织的数据。每当我们需要对事实达成共识时，我们就会使用账本。账本记录了支撑现代经济的事实。

Ledgers confirm ownership. Property title registers map who owns what and whether their land is subject to any caveats or encumbrances. Hernando de Soto has documented how the poor suffer when they own property that has not been confirmed in a ledger. The firm is a ledger, as a network of ownership, employment and production relationships with a single purpose. A club is a ledger, structuring who benefits and who does not.

账本确认所有权。账本财产条目登记了谁拥有什么土地以及他们的土地是否有某种诉讼或财产置留。Hernando de Soto 已经描述了，穷人如何遭遇痛苦，当他们自己的财产没有被一个账本确认的时候。公司是一种账本，由基于同一目的的所有权、雇佣关系和生产关系构成。一个俱乐部是一种账本，格式记录了谁受益，谁不受益。

Ledgers confirm identity. Businesses have identities recorded on government ledgers to track their existence and their status under tax law. The register of Births Deaths and Marriages records the existence of individuals at key moments, and uses that information to confirm identities when those individuals are interacting with the world.

帐本确认身份。政府在账本上在记录企业的身份，以追踪他们的存在以及他们交税的状态。出生死亡和婚姻情况的登记帐本，记录了某个关键时刻的个体存在，并利用这些信息来确认个人身份，当这些个人与世界交互时。

Ledgers confirm status. Citizenship is a ledger, recording who has the rights and is subject to obligations due to national membership. The electoral roll is a ledger, allowing (and, in Australia, obliging) those who are on that roll a vote. Employment is a ledger, giving those employed a contractual claim on payment in return for work.

帐本确认状态。公民身份是一种帐本，记录了以他的国籍身份所拥有的权利以及应尽的义务。选举名册是一种帐本，允许(在澳大利亚，强制要求)谁能在选举中投票。就业是一种账本，给那些被雇佣的人，以合同的方式支付工作报酬。

Ledgers confirm authority. Ledgers identify who can validly sit in parliament, who can access what bank account, who can work with children, who can enter restricted areas.

帐本确认权限。帐本确定谁有权坐到议会中，谁有权查询银行账户，谁有权能和孩子们一起工作，谁有权进入受限制的地区。

At their most fundamental level, ledgers map economic and social relationships.

在最基本的层面上，帐本记录了经济和社会关系。

Agreement about the facts and when they change — that is, a consensus about what is in the ledger, and a trust that the ledger is accurate — is one of the fundamental bases of market capitalism.

对事实以及事实何时改变的一致意见——也就是说，对帐本上的内容和准确性共识——是资本主义市场的核心基础之一。

Ownership, possession, and ledgers  所有权、占用权和帐本

Let’s make a distinction here that is crucial but easy to miss: between ownership and possession.

让我们在这里做个区分，这很重要，但很容易被忽略：所有权和占有权。

Take passports. Each country asserts the right to control who crosses its borders, and each country maintains a ledger of which of its citizens have the right to travel. A passport is a physical item — call it a token — that refers back to this ledger.

以护照为例。每个国家都声称有权控制谁可以通过他的边界，每个国家都维护一个账本，记录他的公民有权外出。护照是一个实物物品，可称它为一个记号，它指向这个账本。

In the pre-digital world, possession indicated ownership of that right. The Australian passport ledger consisted of index cards held in by the government of each state. Border agents presented with a passport could surmise that the traveller who held it was listed on a distant ledger as allowed to travel. Of course this left border control highly exposed to fraud.

在数字世界之前，占有权表示对这一权利的所有权。澳大利亚护照帐本由各州政府持有的索引卡组成。边境探员可以推测，持有护照的旅客即已列在遥远的政府帐本上，是允许外出的。当然，这让边界控制高度暴露在欺诈行为中。

A Belgian passport held by the Australian National Archives, A435 1944/4/2579

一本比利时护照， 澳大利亚国家档案馆收藏，A435 1944/4/2579

Possession implies ownership, but possession is not ownership. Now modern passports allow the authorities to confirm ownership directly. Their digital features allow airlines and immigration authorities to query the national passport database and determine that a passenger is free to travel.

占用权表示所有权,但不是所有权。现代护照允许当局直接确认所有权。他们的数字特征使航空公司和移民局可以查询国家护照数据库，并确定乘客是可以自由外出。

Passports are a relatively straightforward example of this distinction. But as Bitcoin has shown: money is a ledger, too.

护照是这种区别的，一个相对简单的例子。但正如比特币所显示的那样:货币也是一种账本。

Possession of a banknote token indicates ownership. In the nineteenth century the possessor — ‘bearer’ — of a banknote had a right to draw on the issuing bank the value of the note. These banknotes were direct liabilities for the issuing bank, and were recorded on the banks’ ledger. A regime of possession indicating ownership meant that banknotes were susceptible to be both stolen and forged.

持有银行票据表明着所有权。在19世纪，银行票据持有人，有权在发行银行的纸币上，画出纸币的价值。银行票据是发行银行的直接债务，并被记录在银行的账本上。一个拥有即所有的制度下，票据很容易被偷窃和伪造。

In our era fiat currencies a five dollar bill cannot be returned to the central bank for gold. But the relationship remains — the value of the bill is dependent on a social consensus about the stability of the currency and government that issued it. Banknotes are not wealth, as Zimbabweans and Yugoslavians and Weimar Republic Germans have unfortunately learned. A bill is a call on a relationship in a (now synthetic) ledger and if that relationship collapses, so does the value of the bill.

在我们的时代，法定货币的五美元纸币不能被归还给中央银行以兑换黄金。但这一关系仍然存在——该法币的价值依赖于社会共识，即货币的稳定性和发行的政府。钞票不是财富，正如津巴布韦人和德国人以及魏玛共和国的德国人不幸地学会了这方面的知识。一项法币是对一个(现在是合成的)账本上的关系的声明，如果这种关系破裂，账单的价值也会随之崩溃。

### The evolution of the ledger   帐本的演变

For all its importance, ledger technology has been mostly unchanged … until now.

尽管它的重要性，帐本的技术基本没有改变，直到现在。

Ledgers appear at the dawn of written communication. Ledgers and writing developed simultaneously in the Ancient Near East to record production, trade, and debt. Clay tablets baked with cuneiform script detailed units of rations, taxes, workers and so forth. The first international ‘community’ was arranged through a structured network of alliances that functioned a lot like a distributed ledger.

在书面交流的开端，帐本就出现了。在古代近东地区，帐本和写作同时发展，记录生产、贸易和债务。土制版的泥片，详细地描述了定量配给、税收、工人等情况。第一个国际“社区”通过一个结构化的联盟网络来组织，就像一个分布式的账本。



A fragment of a late Babylonian cuneiform ledger, held by the British Museum, 58278

巴比伦晚期楔形文字帐本，英国国家博物馆收藏，58278

The first major change to ledgers appeared in the fourteenth century with the invention of double entry bookkeeping. By recording both debits and credits, double entry bookkeeping conserved data across multiple (distributed) ledgers, and allowed for the reconciliation of information between ledgers.

帐本第一个主要的变化，是出现在14世纪，复式记账的发明。通过同时记录借方和贷方的记录，复式记账在多个(分布式)帐本上保存数据，并允许在帐本之间进行信息的核对。

The nineteenth century saw the next advance in ledger technology with the rise of large corporate firms and large bureaucracies. These centralised ledgers enabled dramatic increases in organisational size and scope, but relied entirely on trust in the centralised institutions.

19世纪，随着大公司和大机构的兴起，帐本技术的发展又出现了新的发展。这些中心化的帐本，帮助一个组织在规模和范围有了巨大的增长，但完全依赖于对中央机构的信任。

In the late twentieth century ledgers moved from analog to digital ledgers. For example, in the 1970s the Australian passport ledger was digitised and centralised. A database allows for more complex distribution, calculation, analysis and tracking. A database is computable and searchable.

在二十世纪后期，帐本从模拟账本发展数字账本。例如，在上世纪70年代，澳大利亚把护照帐本数字化和集中化。数据库允许更复杂的分布、计算、分析和跟踪。数据库是可计算的，可搜索的。

But a database still relies on trust; a digitised ledger is only as reliable as the organisation that maintains it (and the individuals they employ). It is this problem that the blockchain solves. The blockchain is a distributed ledgers that does not rely on a trusted central authority to maintain and validate the ledger.

但是数据库仍然依赖于信任；数字化的帐本与维护它的组织(以及他们雇佣的个人)的可靠性一样。正是区块链解决了这个问题。区块链是一种分布式的帐本，不依赖于受信任的中央权威来维护和验证帐本。

Blockchain and the economic institutions of capitalism  区块链和资本主义经济制度

The economic structure of modern capitalism has evolved in order service these ledgers.

现代资本主义的经济结构是为了服务这些帐本而发展起来的。

Oliver Williamson, the 2009 Nobel laureate in economics, argued that people produce and exchange in markets, firms, or governments depending on the relative transactions costs of each institution. Williamson’s transactions cost approach provides a key to understanding what institutions manage ledgers and why.

2009年诺贝尔经济学奖得主奥利弗威廉姆森认为，人们在市场、公司或政府之间进行交易，取决于该制度下的相对交易成本。威廉姆森的交易成本方法提供了一把钥匙，可以了解帐本管理的内容和原因。

Governments maintain ledgers of authority, privilege, responsibility and access. Governments are the trusted entity that keeps databases of citizenship and the right to travel, taxation obligations, social security entitlements, and property ownership. Where a ledger requires coercion in order to be enforced, the government is required.

政府维持着有关权威、特权、责任和准入的帐本。政府是一个值得信赖的实体，它拥有公民身份和权利的数据库，包括外出、税收、社会保障和财产所有权。如果一个帐本需要强制执行，那么就需要政府。

Firms also maintain ledgers: proprietary ledgers of employment and responsibility, of the ownership and deployment of physical and human capital, of suppliers and customers, of intellectual property and corporate privilege. A firm is often described as a ‘nexus of contracts’. But the value of the firm comes from the way that nexus is ordered and structured — the firm is in fact a ledger of contracts and capital.

公司也维护了自己的帐本：雇员和岗位的帐本，实物和人力资本所有权和部署情况的帐本，供应商和客户的帐本，知识产权和公司权益方面的帐本。一家公司通常被描述为“合同关系”。但该公司的价值来自于关系的订立和组织——公司实际上是一份合同和资本的帐本。

Firms and governments can use blockchains to make their work more efficient and reliable. Multinational firms and networks of firms need to reconcile transactions on a global basis and blockchains can allow them to do so near-instantaneously. Governments can use the immutability of the blockchain to guarantee that property titles and identity records are accurate and untampered. Well-designed permissioning rules on blockchain applications can give citizens and consumers more control over their data.

公司和政府可以利用区块链来提高效率和可靠性。跨国公司和公司网络需要在全球范围内协调交易，而区块链可以让他们准实时完成交易。政府可以利用区块链的不可变性来保证产权和身份记录的准确性和不可篡改性。在区块链应用程序上，设计良好的许可规则，可以让公民和消费者对他们的数据有更多的控制权。

But blockchains also compete against firms and governments. The blockchain is an institutional technology. It is a new way to maintain a ledger — that is, coordinate economic activity — distinct from firms and governments.

但是，区块链也会与公司和政府竞争。区块链是一种制度技术。这是一种维护帐本的新方法——也就是协调经济活动——与公司和政府截然不同。



### The new economic institutions of capitalism  资本主义的新经济体系

Blockchains can be used by firms, but they can also replace firms. A ledger of contracts and capital can now be decentralised and distributed in a way they could not before. Ledgers of identity, permission, privilege and entitlement can be maintained and enforced without the need for government backing.

区块链可以被公司使用，但也可以代替公司。现在，一份合同和资本的账本，可以去中心化和分布式，以一种以前不可能的方式。身份、许可、特权和权利的帐本可以在不需要政府支持的情况下维持和执行。

Institutional cryptoeconomics  制度加密经济学

This is what institutional cryptoeconomics studies: the institutional consequences of cryptographically secure and trustless ledgers.

这就是制度加密经济学研究的内容:加密安全可靠和无信任账本的制度后果。

Classical and neoclassical economists understand the purpose of economics as studying the production and distribution of scarce resources, and the factors which underpinned that production and distribution.

古典和新古典主义经济学家理解经济学的目的，是研究稀缺资源的生产和分配，以及支撑生产和分配的要素。

Institutional economics understands the economy as made of rules. Rules (like laws, languages, property rights, regulations, social norms, and ideologies) allow dispersed and opportunistic people to coordinate their activity together. Rules facilitate exchange — economic exchange but also social and political exchange as well.

制度经济学认为经济是由规则构成的。规则(如法律、语言、产权、规章、社会规范和意识形态)允许分散的和投机的人们一起协调他们的活动。规则促进了交流——经济交流，也促进了社会和政治交流。

What has come to be called cryptoeconomics focuses on the economic principles and theory underpinning the blockchain and alternative blockchain implementations. It looks at game theory and incentive design as they relate to blockchain mechanism design.

所谓的“加密经济学”，主要关注的是支撑区块链实现的经济原则和理论。它关注的是博弈论和激励设计，因为它们与区块链机制设计有关。

By contrast, institutional cryptoeconomics looks at the institutional economics of the blockchain and cryptoeconomy. Like its close cousin institutional economics, the economy is a system to coordinate exchange. But rather than looking at rules, institutional cryptoeconomics focuses on ledgers: data structured by rules.

相比之下，制度加密经济学研究的是区块链和加密经济的制度经济学。就像它的近亲，制度经济学一样，经济是一个协调交流的系统。但是，制度加密经济学并不关注规则，而是关注于帐本：由规则构成的数据。

Institutional cryptoeconomics is interested in the rules that govern ledgers, the social, political, and economic institutions that have developed to service those ledgers, and how the invention of the blockchain changes the patterns of ledgers throughout society.

制度加密经济学感兴趣的是管理账本、社会、政治和经济机构的规则，这些规则开发出来为账本服务，以及区块链发明如何改变了整个社会的帐本模式。

### The economic consequences of the blockchain   区块链的经济后果

Institutional cryptoeconomics gives us the tools to understand what is happening in the blockchain revolution — and what we can’t predict.

制度加密经济学为我们提供了工具，让我们了解区块链革命中正在发生的事情，以及我们无法预测的事情。

Blockchains are an experimental technology. Where the blockchain can be used is an entrepreneurial question. Some ledgers will move onto the blockchain. Some entrepreneurs will try to move ledgers onto the blockchain and fail. Not everything is a blockchain use case. We probably haven’t yet seen the blockchain killer app yet. Nor can we predict what the combination of ledgers, cryptography, peer to peer networking will throw up in the future.

区块链是一项正在发展中的技术。在什么地方使用区块链是一个创业的问题。一些帐本将转移到区块链上。一些创业者会尝试将账本转移到区块链上，但失败了。并非所有东西，都适合使用区块链。我们可能还没有看到区块链杀手应用。我们也无法预测未来将会发生什么，当账本、密码学、点对点网络组合在一起。

This process is going to be extremely disruptive. The global economy faces (what we expect will be) a lengthy period of uncertainty about how the facts that underpin it will be restructured, dismantled, and reorganised.

这一过程将是极具颠覆性的。全球经济面临着(我们所期望的)一个漫长的不确定时期，关于支撑它的帐本将如何被重组、解体和重构。

The best uses of the blockchain have to be ‘discovered’. Then they have to be implemented in a real world political and economic system that has deep, established institutions that already service ledgers. That second part will not be cost free.

区块链的最佳用途，必须是“被发现”。然后，它们必须在现实世界的政治和经济体系中实现，这个体系中已经拥有深厚的、已建立的各种制度，它们已经在为帐本服务。这将不会是无成本实现的。

Ledgers are so pervasive — and the possible applications of the blockchain so all-encompassing — that some of the most fundamental principles governing our society are up for grabs.

帐本是如此普遍，区块链的可能应用如此广泛，以至于一些最基本的管理我们社会的原则都还未确定。

### Institutional creative destruction  制度创新的颠覆性

We’ve been through revolutions like this before.

我们以前经历过这样的革命。

It is common to compare the invention of Bitcoin and the blockchain with the internet. The blockchain is Internet 2.0 — or Internet 4.0. The internet is a powerful tool that has revolutionised the way we interact and do business. But if anything the comparison undersells the blockchain. The internet has allowed us to communicate and exchange better — more quickly, more efficiently.

将比特币和区块链的发明与互联网相比是很常见的。区块链是互联网2.0或互联网4.0。互联网是一种强大的工具，它彻底改变了我们的互动方式和商业模式。但如果将两者比较的话，那也是低估了区块链。互联网使我们能够更好地交流和交流——更快、更有效率。

But the blockchain allows us to exchange differently. A better metaphor for the blockchain is the invention of mechanical time.

但区块链允许我们以不同的方式进行交易。区块链的一个更好的比喻是机械时间的发明。

Before mechanical time, human activity was temporally regulated by nature: the crow of the rooster in the morning, the slow descent into darkness at night. As the economic historian Douglas W. Allen argues, the problem was variability: “there was simply too much variance in the measurement of time … to have a useful meaning in many daily activities”.

在机械时间之前，人类的活动是由自然时间调节的：早上公鸡的啼叫，夜晚的缓慢下降。正如经济历史学家Douglas W. Allen所指出的那样，问题在于可变性：“在时间的测量上存在太多的差异……在许多日常活动中都有意义。”



The 12th century Jayrun Water Clock    12世纪的Jayrun水钟

“The effect of the reduction in the variance of time measurement was felt everywhere”, Allen writes. Mechanical time opened up entirely new categories of economic organisation that had until then been not just impossible, but unimaginable. Mechanical time allowed trade and exchange to be synchronised across great distances. It allowed for production and transport to be coordinated. It allowed for the day to be structured, for work to be compensated according to the amount of time worked — and for workers to know that they were being compensated fairly. Both employers and employees could look at a standard, independent instrument to verify that a contract had been performed.

Allen 写道:“时间测量的差异减少，所带来的影响随处可见。”机械时代开启了全新的经济组织，在此之前，不仅是不可能，而且是不可想象的。机械时间允许贸易和交换在很远的地方同步。它允许生产和运输协调。它允许一天的工作，根据工作时间的获得报酬，并且让工人知道他们得到的报酬是公平的。雇主和雇员都可以看到，一种标准的、独立的工具，来验证合同是否已经执行。

### Complete and incomplete smart contracts  完全和不完全智能合约

Oliver Williamson and Ronald Coase (who was also an economics Nobel prize winner, in 1991) put contracts at the heart of economic and business organisation. Contracts are at the centre of institutional cryptoeconomics. It is here that blockchains have the most revolutionary implications.

Oliver Williamson and Ronald Coase(也是1991年诺贝尔经济学奖得主)将合同放在经济和商业组织的核心。合同是制度加密经济学的核心。在这里，区块链具有最革命性的意义。

Smart contracts on the blockchain allows for contractual agreements to be automatically, autonomously, and securely executed. Smart contracts can eliminate an entire class of work that currently maintains, enforces and confirms that contracts are executed — accountants, auditors, lawyers, and indeed much of the legal system.

区块链上的智能合约允许合同协议自动、自治、安全地执行。智能合约可以消除目前维护、贯彻和确认合同执行的整个工作——会计、审计人员、律师，以及许多法律系统。

But the smart contracts are limited by what can be specified in the algorithm. Economists have focused on the distinction between complete and incomplete contracts.

但是，智能合约受到算法设定的限制。经济学家关注的是完整和不完整合约之间的区别。

A complete contract specifies what is to occur under every possible contingency. An incomplete contract allows the terms of the contract to be renegotiated in the case of unexpected events. Incomplete contracts provide one explanation for why some exchanges take place in firms, and why others take place in markets, and provides a further guide to questions surrounding vertical integration and the size of the firm.

一份完整的合约明确了在所有可能的情况下，发生的事情。一份不完整的合约允许在意外事件的情况下，重新谈判合同条款。不完整的合同提供了一种解释，解释了为什么有些交易发生在公司，为什么其他的交易发生在市场上，并且为垂直整合和公司规模的问题，提供了进一步的指导。

Complete contracts are impossible to execute, while incomplete contracts are expensive. The blockchain, though smart contracts, lowers the information costs and transactions costs associated with many incomplete contracts and so expands the scale and scope of economic activity that can be undertaken. It allows markets to operate where before only large firms could operate, and it allows business and markets to operate where before only government could operate.

完全的合同是不可能执行的，而不完全的合同是昂贵的。区块链，通过智能合同，降低了与许多不完整合同相关的信息成本和交易成本，从而扩大了经济活动的规模和范围。它允许在市场中运作，以前只有大公司才能做到的运作，允许商业和市场运作，以前只有政府才能进行的运作。

The precise details of how and when this will occur is a challenge and a problem for entrepreneurs to resolve. Currently, oracles provide a link between the algorithmic world of the blockchain and the real world, trusted entities that convert information into data that can be processed by a smart contract.

具体描述这是如何以及何时发生的，是一个挑战，也是创业者需要解决的问题。目前，区块链预言机提供了区块链的算法世界与现实世界之间的联系，预言机可信实体，将信息转化为可以通过智能合约处理的数据。

The real gains to be made in the blockchain revolution, we suggest, are in developing better and more powerful oracles — converting incomplete contracts to contracts that are sufficiently complete to be written algorithmically and executed on the blockchain.

我们认为，区块链革命带来的真正进步，是开发出更好、更强大的预言机——将不完全的合约转化为用算法写成的完全合约，并在区块链上执行。

The merchant revolution of the middle ages was made possible by the development of merchant courts — effectively trusted oracles — that allowed traders to enforce agreements privately. For blockchain, that revolution seems yet to come.

中世纪的商业革命之所以成为可能，是因为商业法庭的发展——有效受信任的 神示所——允许商人私人之间执行协议。对于区块链来说，这场革命似乎即将到来。

### Whither government?  政府将走向何方?

The blockchain economy puts pressure on government processes in a whole host of ways, from taxation, to regulation, to service delivery.

区块链经济，从税收、监管到服务传递等一系列方面，给政府行政过程施加了压力。

Investigating these changes is an ongoing project of ours. But consider, for instance, how we regulate banks.

调查研究这些变化，是我们一个正在进行的项目。举个例子，考虑一下我们如何监管银行。

Prudential controls have evolved to ensure the safety and soundness of financial institutions that interact with the public. Typically these controls (for example, liquidity and capital requirements) have been justified by the fact that depositors and shareholders are unable to observe the bank’s ledger. The depositors and shareholders are unable to discipline the firm and its management.

为了确保金融机构的安全和健康，以便服务公众，谨慎控制已经得到了发展。通常情况下，谨慎控制(例如，流动性和资本要求)是合理的，因为储户和股东无法看到银行的账本。存款人和股东不能对公司及其管理进行约束。

Bank runs occur when depositors discover (or simply imagine) that their bank might not be able to cover their deposits, and they rush to withdraw their money.

银行挤兑会发生，当储户发现(或简单地想象)他们的银行可能无法支付他们的存款，急忙取回自己钱的时候。



The bank run in Mary Poppins (1964)   欢乐满人间 (1964)中银行挤兑

One possible application of the blockchain would allow depositors and shareholders to continuously monitor the bank’s reserves and lendings, substantially eliminating the information asymmetries between them and the bank management.

区块链的一个可能应用，是允许储户和股东持续监控银行的准备金和借贷情况，实质上消除储户与银行管理层之间信息的不对称。

In this world, market discipline would be possible. Public trust in the immutability of the blockchain would ensure no false bank runs occurred. The role of the regulator might be limited to certifying the blockchain was correctly and securely structured.

在这个世界里，市场规则是可能的。公众对于区块链不可变性的信任，将确保不会出现错误的银行挤兑。监管机构的作用，可能仅限于认证区块链是正确和安全的。

A more far reaching application would be a cryptobank — an autonomous blockchain application that borrows short and lends long, perhaps matching borrowers with lenders directly. A cryptobank structured algorithmically by smart contracts would have the same transparency properties as the bank with a public blockchain ledger but with other features that might completely neglect the need for regulators. For example, a cryptobank could be self-liquidating. At the moment the cryptobank began trading while insolvent, the underlying assets would be automatically disbursed to shareholders and depositors.

一个更深远的应用将是一个加密银行——一个自动的区块链应用程序，它可以短期借款，并长期贷款，或许还可以将借款人和贷款人直接进行匹配。加密银行，一种由算法构成的智能合约，将与拥有公共区块链账本的银行具有同样的透明度，在其他方面，是不需要监管机构的。例如，一家加密银行可以自行清算。当一家加密银行开始破产清算时，潜在的资产将自动支付给股东和储户。

It is unclear what regulatory role government should have in this world.

目前还不清楚，政府应该在这个世界里，扮演什么样的监管角色。

Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok have argued that much government regulation appears to be designed to resolve asymmetric information problems — problems that, in a world of information ubiquity, often do not exist any more. Blockchain applications significantly increase this information ubiquity, and make that information more transparent, permanent, and accessible.

Tyler Cowen和Alex Tabarrok认为，政府的监管似乎是为了解决不对称的信息问题——一个，在信息普遍存在的世界中，往往并不存在的问题。区块链应用程序显著地，增加了这种信息的普遍性，使信息更加透明、永久和可访问。

Blockchains have their uses in what is being called ‘regtech’ — the application of technology to the traditional regulatory functions of auditing, compliance, and market surveillance. And we ought not to dismiss the possibility that there will be new economic problems that demand new consumer protections or market controls in the blockchain world.

区块链在所谓的“监管科技”中有用武之地，即技术应用于传统的审计、合规和市场监管。我们不应该忽视这样一种可能性:在区块链领域，会出现新的经济问题，需要新的消费者保护或市场控制。

Nevertheless, the restructuring and recreation of basic economic forms like banks will put pressure not just on how regulation is enforced, but what the regulation should do.

然而，像银行这样基本经济形式的重构和再生，不仅会给监管的执行带来压力，还会对监管的内容带来压力。

### Whither Big Business?  大企业向何处去?

The implications for big business are likely to be just as profound. Business size is often driven by the need to cover the costs of business hierarchy — in turn due to incomplete contracts and technological necessity of large scale financial investment. That business model has meant that shareholder capitalism is the dominant form of business organisation. The ability to write more complete contracts on the blockchain means that entrepreneurs and innovators will be able to maintain ownership and control of their human capital and profit at the same time. The nexus between operating a successful business and access to financial capital has been weakening over time, but now might even be broken. The age of human capitalism is dawning

对大企业的影响可能同样深远。业务规模通常，由需要支付业务层级的成本所驱动，因为不完全的合同和大规模金融投资技术需求。这种商业模式意味着，股东资本是商业组织的主导形式。在区块链上写入更完全合同的能力，意味着企业家和创新者将能够同时维护其人力资本和利润的所有权和控制权。成功经营一家企业和获取金融资本之间的联系，一直在减弱，但现在可能会被打破。 人力资本的时代正在到来。

Entrepreneurs will be able to write a valuable app and release it into the “wild” ready to be employed by anyone and everyone who needs that functionality. The entrepreneur in turn simply observe micro-payments accumulating in their wallet. A designer could release their design into the “wild” and final consumers could download that design to their 3D printer and have the product almost immediately. This business model could see more (localised) manufacturing occur in Australia than at present.

创业者将能够编写一款有价值的应用，并将其发布，随时准备被任何需要该功能的人使用。而创业者则简单地观察他们钱包里的小额支付情况。设计师可以将他们的设计发布，最终的消费者可以将他们的设计下载到他们的3D打印机中，几乎可以立即得到产品。在澳大利亚，这种商业模式将会更多的发生，相比于现在。

The ability of consumers to interact directly with producers or designers will limit the role that middlemen play in the economy. Logistics firms, however, will continue to prosper, but the advent of driverless transportation will see disruption to industry too.

消费者与生产者或设计师直接互动，将限制中间商在经济中所扮演的角色。物流公司将继续蓬勃发展，无人驾驶交通的出现也将颠覆现代工业。

Bear in mind, any disruption of business will also disrupt the company tax base. It may become difficult for government to tax business at all — so we might see greater pressure on sales (consumption) taxes and even poll taxes.

请记住，任何业务的颠覆都会扰乱公司税基。政府对企业征税可能会变得困难，因此我们可能会看到对销售(消费)税，甚至是投票税的更大压力。

Conclusion  结论

The blockchain and associated technological changes will massively disrupt current economic conditions. The industrial revolution ushered in a world where business models were predicated on hierarchy and financial capitalism. The blockchain revolution will see an economy dominated by human capitalism and greater individual autonomy.

区块链和相关技术变革将极大改变当前的经济情况。工业革命开创了一个世界，在这个世界里，商业模式建立在层级制度和金融资本主义的基础上。区块链革命，将会出现一个由人力资本主义和更大的个人自治所主导的经济。

How that unfolds is unclear at present. Entrepreneurs and innovators will resolve uncertainty, as always, through a process of trial and error. No doubt great fortunes will be made and lost before we know exactly how this disruption will unfold.

目前尚不清楚这个颠覆将如何展开的。创业者和创新者将一如既往地为我们揭晓这个不确定性，通过不断反复地试错。毫无疑问，我们将会获得或者失去巨大的财富机会，在我们确切知道这一颠覆将如何展开之前。

Our contribution is that we have a clear understanding of a model that can be deployed to provide clarity to the disruption as and when it occurs.

我们的贡献是，我们有一个清晰的理解模型，可以说明，颠覆是如何发生以及何时发生。
