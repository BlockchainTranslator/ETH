Bitcoin pushed its record high valuation higher again this month! Who believes that cryptocurrencies will replace all existing currencies and be a viable alternative to government-issued currencies now?

比特币本月再次创历史新高！ 谁敢相信加密货币能取代所有现有货币，成为政府发行货币的可行的替代品？

Well, all cryptocurrencies are not created equal. What’s disturbing in cryptocurrencies today is that despite their insanely high market capitalizations, almost no cryptocurrency is primarily used for what it’s supposed to: trading goods and services. When their value/market cap is going through the roof, it’s because investors hope that they will eventually evolve into something that people will use to trade goods and services, which would stabilize their value at a level higher than today. But let’s see why it is not the case today.

不是所有的加密货币都被平等创建的。对于当前的加密货币来说，令人不安的是尽管他们有疯狂的高市值，但几乎没有一个加密货币被用于做它应该做的：交易商品和服务。他们的价值/市值飞速增长，是因为投资者希望他们最终将演变成人们将用于交易商品和服务的东西，这将使其价值稳定在比现在更高的水平。但是让我们看看现在为什么不是这样。

# The value of a currency is usually a measure of how much people trust they can use it #

**货币的价值通常用来衡量有多少人相信他们可以使用它**

![Anything is a currency if you believe it. For the Aztecs, it was Cocoa beans](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LUgDnKy7TRBwx-tluHqKFg.jpeg)

A currency is by definition something that:
(1) Sets a price reference
(2) Can be used to exchange goods and services
(3) Can be used as a storage of value

根据定义，货币是：
(1). 设定价格参考
(2). 可用于交换商品和服务
(3). 可用于价值存储

What’s important to note is that these conditions are always met at a certain defined place (on a market), and within a certain time interval.

需要注意的是，这些条件总是在某些明确的地方（市场上）和一定时间间隔内被满足。

Even for government issued currencies, these conditions are true only on the currency’s home market, which happens to be often delimited geographically, but not always. The Swiss Franc for instance meets these conditions in Switzerland but also in neighboring regions of France, Italy, Germany and Austria. Indian Rupees and Russian Rubles also fully meet the requirements on their respective markets. Yet, earlier this year, I wasn’t able to exchange my Indian Rupees for Russian Rubles at a decent rate anywhere in Moscow. Because Russia’s trade with India is relatively unimportant, Rupees are less exchangeable against goods and services on this market, which decreases their value. As such, the Rupee does not represent a currency on the Russian consumer market.

即使对于政府发行的货币，这些条件只适用于货币的本国市场，而且恰好经常在地理上被划分，但并不总是如此。例如瑞士法郎，不光在瑞士满足这些条件，也适用于法国，意大利，德国和奥地利这些邻近地区。印度卢比和俄罗斯卢布也完全符合各自市场的要求。然而，今年早些时候，我无法在莫斯科的任何地方的用合适的汇率将印度卢比兑换成俄罗斯卢布。由于俄罗斯与印度的贸易相对不重要，卢比在这个市场上的货物和服务交换较少，这降低了它的价值。因此，印度卢比并不代表俄罗斯消费市场的货币。

# No currency is a currency in a vacuum. Currencies exist on a specific market. #

# 没有凭空出现的货币。货币存在于特定市场。#

Most cryptocurrencies don’t pass the test for being a currency on any market at all. Almost no cryptocurrency succeeds at being a price reference (1). All prices in coins are always converted from their dollar value before a transaction happens. Most of them also fail at being convertible against goods and services (2). None of us could survive or run a business on any market if our revenue was to be spent only in any of these currencies. And (3) can only be met if the first two conditions are met, in the case of currencies.

大多数加密货币根本不通过任何市场上的货币测试。几乎没有一个货币在作为一个价格参考上是成功的 (1). 在交易发生之前，硬币中的所有价格总是从其美元价值转换而来。他们中的大多数也不能兑换货物和服务 (2). 如果我们的收入仅用于这些货币中任意一个，我们不可能在任何市场上生存或经营业务。并且对于货币来说 (3) 只有在满足前两个条件的情况下才能满足。

In fact, I counted the number of merchants online who are willing to take the top 30 cryptocurrencies (with market caps ranging from $200M to $7B+) as a form of payment:
- < 10'000 businesses accept Bitcoin in the world
- < 500 businesses for each other currency than Bitcoin and Ether (more likely <<100)

事实上，我计算了愿意采取前30名加密货币 (市值从2亿美元到7亿美元) 作为一种付款方式的在线商家的数量:
- 只有少于10万家企业在世界上接受比特币
- 只有少于500家的企业愿意接受除了比特币和以太币以外的加密货币（更有可能是小于100家）

# Coins fight over which one has the best technical performance, not on solving any subset of users’ problem #

**货币比拼中哪一个具有最好的技术性能，而不是解决任何一个用户的问题**

**“Having No Specific User in Mind”** was listed years ago already by Paul Graham as one of [the 18 mistakes that kill startups](http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html). YC even has t-shirts to make sure they never forget to **“build something people want”**.

保罗·格雷厄姆（Paul Graham）已经在几年前就列出了**“心中没有目标用户”**，作为[杀死创业公司的18个错误之一](http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html)。YC 甚至有T恤，以确保他们永远不会忘记**“建立人们想要的东西”**。

Cryptocurrencies need adoption in the same way any other digital product does and hence should solve the problem of someone to be successful. Yet a majority of cryptocurrencies seem to be aimed at solving the problems of the whole world at a time, failing at achieving currency status on any market.

加密货币需要采用与其他数字产品相同的方式，因此应该以解决某些人的问题来作为成功。然而，绝大多数加密货币似乎都是为了一次性解决全世界的问题，却没有在任何市场上实现货币地位。

![How I perceive some cryptocurrencies have differentiated](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*y8f6QiVS5cfuUbgjLpadDA.png)

Back in engineering school, we were taught that if you gave the same problem to solve to 3 different engineers, say an electronics engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a software engineer, you would end up with different 3 solutions to this problem: one using electronics, one using mechanics, and one using software. All solutions are valid, as long as you end up solving the right problem: the one that matters to your customers.

回到工程学校，我们被教导，如果你要求3个不同的工程师去解决同样的问题，一个电子工程师，一个机械工程师和一个软件工程师，你会得到不同的3个解决方案来解决这个问题：一个使用 电子学，一个使用力学，一个使用软件。所有解决方案都是有效的，只要您最终解决的是正确的问题：那个对客户至关重要的问题。

The top-30 coins with the highest market capitalizations are almost all competing over their technical specificities like the size of the blocks, confirmation times, safer encryption or safety in the case of rare kind of attacks. But is it really what is stopping a market from adopting them today? I would say these coins are primarily solving the problems that the engineers writing their code see.

具有最高市值的前30名货币几乎全部与其技术特性相竞争，如块的大小，确认时间，更安全的加密或在罕见的攻击情况下的安全性。但是，这些真的是阻止市场采用他们的原因呢？我会说这些货币主要是解决工程师编写代码的问题。

Ripple is an example of a currency that was developed with a specific subset of users in mind, that would get tangible benefits from using a cryptocurrency. Ripple is targeting a specific market and marketing itself using the market’s language, showing relevant benefits to its audience.

Ripple是一个为一群特定用户开发的货币的示例，用户可以从使用加密的货币中获得实际的好处。Ripple针对特定市场，并使用该市场的术语营销自己，向观众展示相关的益处。

**The value of all Bitcoins in circulation today ($102 billion) is greater than the value of all Swiss Francs in circulation in cash ($79 billion), and in the same order of magnitude as the Swiss Franc money supply (M1 of $641 billion)**, and yet the _Franc_ is considered one of the most stable currencies of all times, while _Bitcoin_ is considered one of the most volatile. The scale of Bitcoin has reached is not what’s needed to succeed at being a “real currency”.

**当前所有流通的比特币的价值（1020亿美元）大于所有流通中的瑞士法郎的现金价值（790亿美元），并且和瑞士法郎货币供应量（即为640亿美元的M1）有相同的数量级**，但是_法郎_一直被认为是最稳定的货币之一，而_比特币_被认为是最具有波动性的货币之一。比特币达到的规模并不是成功实现“真正货币”所必须的。

# Stability will be reached when a majority of the members of a market will do business mostly through the new currency #

**当大多数市场成员通过新货币进行生意时，就会获得稳定性**

It’s not the tech that should be tuned, it’s the market. There are a legion of markets and industries that **would benefit from the pros of cryptocurrencies without suffering from their current limitations**. The priority is to start with a market that’s small enough so that it’s possible to get a toehold and convert a majority of the parties quickly. After covering a majority of the transactions on this market, it will be possible to expand to neighboring or similar industries thanks to the added trust.

这不是应该调整的技术，而是市场。有一大批**可以从加密货币的优势中收益，而不受当前限制**的市场和行业。优先考虑的是从一个足够小的市场开始获取立足点，并且快速转换大多数相关方。在覆盖了这个市场的大部分交易之后，由于更多的信任，有可能扩展到邻近或类似的行业。

# What to start working on #

**从什么开始工作**

There is a bunch of industries that we’ve looked into, each with a few, easily accessible parties, that can all be reached and potentially converted. If you have knowledge of an industry that matches the criteria, what industry do you think should be targeted first?

我们已经研究了一些行业，每个都有一些易于接触的相关方，这些行业都可以触及和潜在被转换。如果您对符合这些标准的行业有所了解，您认为应该首先将行业定位于哪个行业？
