Why the Brazilian and Argentinian Bitcoin communities oppose SegWit2x

为什么巴西和阿根廷社区反对SegWit2x

In light of the recent initiatives to implement changes to Bitcoin’s protocol, the present signatories — representing the main exchanges, companies, service providers, and hundreds of thousands of users in the region, hereby collectively denominated as the “Brazilian and Argentinian communities” — wish to voice their deepest concerns over the upcoming November hardfork as mandated by the so-called New York Agreement (“NYA”), also known as SegWit2x (“S2X”).

鉴于最近将对比特币协议进行改变的举措，目前的签署方—代表当地主要的交易所、公司、服务提供商及成千上万的用户，特此统称为“巴西和阿根廷社区”，希望对即将到来的11月份硬分叉表达他们最深切的关注，该硬分叉按照所谓的纽约协议（NYA）的规定，也称为SegWit2x（S2X）。

As enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, developers, businessmen, it is our belief we all share the same goal of making Bitcoin succeed and fulfill its huge potential as a disruptive technology, allowing for greater financial freedom, monetary sovereignty and empowerment to each and every individual around the world. We also value Bitcoin’s technological breakthrough for applications well beyond money and borderless payments. But regardless of the use cases, a secure and reliable blockchain is paramount.

作为爱好者、企业家、开发者、商人，我们相信我们都有同样的目标：使得Bitcoin成功并实现其作为一种颠覆性技术的巨大潜力，允许赋予世界各地每一个人更多的财务自由、货币主权和权力。我们也重视比特币除作为金钱和无边界付款之外，在应用方面的技术突破。但是无论用例如何，安全可靠的区块链都是至关重要的。

We do believe the NYA signatories have the best of intentions in attempting to improve Bitcoin’s protocol, and we also recognize the invaluable service historically provided by the companies and the talented individuals associated with S2X. We profoundly disagree, however, with the means chosen to carry out such a plan. And therein lie all the discord, controversy, feverish debates, and even resentment for some actors.

我们确信NYA的签署者有最好的意图去尝试完善比特币的协议，我们也意识到那些跟S2X有关的公司和个人提供过的宝贵服务。然而，我们深深地不同意用这种方式来实施这样一个计划。这其中充满着某些人的不和、争议、激烈辩论，甚至怨恨。

What follows is a non-exhaustive list of the main reasons why the Brazilian and Argentinian communities deem SegWit2x an ill-advised and unwarranted pursuit:

以下不完整列表是巴西和阿根廷社区认为SegWit2x是不明智的和莫须有的原因：

1) An agreement, instead of a proposal: the NYA narrative framed the situation as a scaling gridlock that needed be solved, thus an agreement between relevant actors (developers, miners, exchanges, payment processors) was sought after. But the very nature of an “agreement” between a few parties in a decentralized consensus protocol can be interpreted as an aggression against the network. Bitcoin’s governance model is certainly not perfect, nonetheless it is far from dysfunctional. If a proposed change lacks adherence, status quo remains. That is a strength. Difficulty in changing the protocol — especially when affecting the consensus layer — really is a feature to be commended. BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, there is no Bitcoin Improvement Agreement for the simple reason that users cannot and should not be coerced into adopting unwanted changes to the protocol. As a community, we should strive to propose, educate, and convince. Overriding the governance mechanisms through closed agreements does not foster unity.

1）这是一个协议而不是一个建议：纽约协议将局势定义为需要解决的扩容僵局，从而寻求相关行为者（开发者、矿工、交易所、支付处理商）之间的协议。但是，一个去中心化的共识协议中的一些团体之间的“协议”本质就可以解释为对网络的侵略。比特币的治理模式当然不是完美的，尽管如此它远不是功能失调的。如果提出的改变缺乏遵守，现状仍然会持续。这是一种力量。很难去改变协议（特别是在影响共识层时），确实是值得赞扬的特征。BIP代表比特币改进方案，而不是比特币改进协议，因为用户不能也不应该强制对协议进行不必要的更改。作为社区，我们应该努力提出、教育和说服。通过封闭式协议来推翻治理机制并不能促进统一。

2) Lack of development and objective transparency: from the onset, there was a clear deficiency of transparency and clarity from the leading S2X’s developers. Countless cases of interested parties being barred from freely subscribing to the mailing list, or accessing the slack channel, were verified. That cannot be considered open participation. Although this has somewhat been resolved, it contributed to confusion and suspicion, resulting in many parties simply distrusting or not believing SegWit2x true intentions. In the end, we are left wondering if NYA is genuinely about Bitcoin scaling or simply a subterfuge for a “governance takeover”, if the latter was even possible. Moreover, participation was encouraged only on the basis of obedience to a pre-agreed upon decision. If the technical and security merits of a “2mb hardfork in 3 months” are not permitted to be discussed, participating seems a sterile exercise.

2）缺乏发展以及客观的透明度：从一开始，S2X的开发者的透明度和清晰度明显不足。感兴趣的各方被禁止自由地订阅邮件列表，或被禁止访问slack频道，这样的无数情况已被验证。这不能被视为公开参与。虽然这有所解决，但却引起了混淆和怀疑，导致各方根本不信任或不相信SegWit2x的真实意图。最后，我们不禁想知道NYA是否真的是关于比特币扩容，或者只是一个“治理接管”的诡计，只怕甚至可能是后者。此外，只有遵守先前的决定，才被鼓励参与。如果 “3个月内实行2mb硬分叉”的技术和安全方面的优点不允许被讨论，则参与似乎是无效的。

3) Political compromise, instead of technical upgrade: it has been frequently stated that SegWit2x represented a compromise. Immediate activation of SegWit (BIP141), as many users desired (by conservative measures over 70% of full nodes were already running SegWit ready software by then), and an increase in base blocksize limit to 2mb, as desired by miners and in accordance with an alleged agreement made during the Hong Kong Scaling Conference — though such an agreement was nothing more than a few developers promising to do research and make an open code proposal. A compromise in a decentralized consensus protocol poses a grave problem as it shows little regard for the technical consequences on the whole network. Changes impacting the consensus layer should not be adopted based on accords simply because some participants (be it miners, or merchants, or developers) are insisting on them. It is immensely difficult to make the case this isn’t a politically motivated change, one which has little to do with technological enhancements of the network. If Bitcoin’s protocol can be altered by the sheer pressure of select participants, it means decentralized consensus has failed. It means Bitcoin cannot and will not withstand even greater attacks in the future. To assert that S2X, if successful, sets a bad precedent is a gross understatement.

3）政治妥协而不是技术升级：经常说SegWit2x代表着一个妥协。根据用户期望的立即激活SegWit（BIP141）（通过超70％的完整节点已经运行SegWit的软件这样的保守措施），矿工期望将区块大小增加到2mb，根据所谓的香港扩容会议协议—虽然这样的协议只不过是一些开发者承诺做研究和提交开源代码。去中心化公示协议的妥协是一个严重的问题，因为它几乎没有考虑这对整个网络的技术后果。影响共识层的变化不应仅仅因为其中一些参与者（无论是矿工、商家或开发人员）坚持要求而采用。表明这不是一个政治动机导致的变化是非常困难的，因为这与增强技术方面无关。如果比特币的协议可以因来自某些参与者的巨大压力而改变，那意味着去中心化的共识就失败了。这意味着Bitcoin不能也将不会承受更大的攻击。可以断言，S2X如果成功，开了一个坏的先例仅仅是乐观估计。

4) Consensus imposition, instead of consensus building: as a decentralized free open-source software, changes to bitcoin’s protocol cannot be forced upon users of the network. As previously argued, had the proponents of S2X merely proposed a change, engaged in open and truthful debate, the divisive situation could have been avoided in its entirety. If upgrades are in fact needed, let us build consensus around them.

4）寻求共识而不是建立共识：作为去中心化的自由的开源软件，不能强制网络用户去改变比特币的协议。如前所述，如果S2X的支持者只是提出了一个改变，而且可以进行公开和真实的辩论，那么分裂的局面本可以避免。如果确实是需要进行升级的，那么让我们就此建立共识。

5) Replay protection and unnecessary disruption: this was perhaps one of the most controversial stances by the S2X developing team. The outright refusal, followed by persistent reluctance, to implement strong replay protection gave a sense of recklessness to the entire community. It seems, at times, that S2X aims at deliberately causing disruption in the expectation users will capitulate and end up upgrading to its incompatible implementation. This posture undermines S2X’s own credibility as a legitimate attempt to improve the protocol.

5）重放保护和不必要的中断：这可能是S2X开发团队最有争议的立场之一。不情愿地公然拒绝实施强有力的重放保护，给整个社区带来了一种鲁莽的感觉。有时候，S2X似乎意图故意造成中断，期望用户将投降并最终升级到其不兼容的版本。这种姿态破坏了S2X自己的信誉，作为改进协议的合理尝试。

6) Emphasis on mining to the detriment of users: trust is an emergent property where multiple parties must act in strict conformity to the rules or risk consensus failure. Consensus is achieved by: i) full nodes independently validating transactions, ii) miners aggregating transactions into a block and producing a proof of work, iii) full nodes verifying miners’ blocks, and iv) full nodes selecting the longest valid chain. Seeking majority hashpower as a means to demonstrate consensus is pointless. Miners provide an essential service to the network, but they do not determine consensus. Mining does not define what the rules are. Full nodes enforce rules and defend the network against arbitrary changes by rejecting invalid transactions or blocks. If miners did have the sole power of affecting protocol changes at their own discretion, Bitcoin wouldn’t be a robust and secure network.

6）强调挖矿对用户的损害：信任是一种应急的资源，多方必须严格遵守规则或承受共识失败的风险。通过以下方式实现共识：i）全节点独立验证交易，ii）矿工将交易聚合成一个区块并产生工作量证明，iii）全节点验证矿工产生的区块，以及iv）全节点选择最长的有效链。寻求多数哈希算力作为共识的手段是毫无意义的。矿工为网络提供基本服务，但并不决定共识。挖矿不能定义什么是规则。完整的节点通过拒绝无效的交易或区块，来执行规则并保护网络免受任意更改。如果矿工确实可以根据自己的想法和唯一的权力来影响协议变更，Bitcoin不会是一个健壮和安全的网络。

7) Impatience over prudence: hardforking, by definition, means breaking backwards compatibility. Hardforking without consensus guarantees a chain split. For a network worth billions of dollars being used by millions of users, allowing for sufficient planning, testing, and preparation should be a self-imposed best practice. Unfortunately, S2X’s implementation (btc1 core) adopted a hasty timeline for activating a hardfork, risking leaving a significant portion of users adrift. Additionally, the so-called “quiet period” before the date of activation makes S2X all the more worrying. We would have preferred to see the risk of a chain split being mitigated by open and intensive testing instead. Downplaying backwards compatibility and security issues makes us extremely uneasy about running btc1 core software.

7）谨慎的态度：根据定义，硬分叉意味着破坏向后兼容性。没有共识的硬分叉将导致链分裂。对于数百万用户使用的价值数百亿美元的网络，允许进行充分的规划、测试和准备应该是自我进化的最佳实践。不幸的是，S2X（btc1 core）采取了一个仓促的时间安排来激活硬分叉，有可能使很大一部分用户流失。此外，激活之前所谓的“安静时期”使S2X更令人担忧。我们更希望是其通过开放和密集的测试，来避免链分裂的风险。我们对运行btc1 core软件非常不安，因为其存在的向后兼容性和安全性的问题。

8) A non-solution to a perceived problem: we obviously prefer low fees to high fees, faster confirmations than longer confirmations, but simply raising base blocksize limit to 2mb now is a partial solution at best. As acknowledged by the very proponents of S2X, even 2mb is considered already insufficient and further increases should be implemented soon. If that is the case, does S2X plan on hardforking every 3 or 6 or 12 months? Congestion in the network is not a fundamentally technical problem to Bitcoin’s protocol. It certainly prevents some use cases in the short term, but does not imperil the network’s functionality and utility. We believe preserving Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant properties should be a top priority in protocol development.

8）对于已有的问题来说不是一个解决方案：我们当然希望是低费用而不是高费用，较快的确认而不是更长时间的确认，但是仅仅将区块大小提高到2m，这只是最好的解决方案中的一小个。正如S2X的支持者所承认的那样，即使是2m大小的区块也已经不够用，应该进一步增加。如果是这样，S2X是否计划每3或6或12个月硬分叉一次？网络拥塞并不是Bitcoin协议的根本技术问题。它在短期内肯定会阻止一些用例，但不会危及网络的功能和效用。我们相信保留比特币的审查属性应该是协议开发的首要任务。

9) Externalizing risks, network and market turmoil and potential liabilities: the chances of a chain split overburden exchanges, payment processors, and wallet services that must plan, prepare, and support a new coin in the event of a permanent split, encumbering these third-parties with potential liabilities should they refrain from doing so. Furthermore, it causes network turmoil by requiring participants to take extra precautions prior to the fork to safeguard wallets and by exposing users to possible loss of funds. Averting disorder in the network should be a prime concern in protocol upgrades, it is unfortunate to realize S2X might accomplish the very opposite. Lastly, uncertainty originated from S2X tends to reverberate negatively in the markets affecting asset prices across cryptocurrencies in general.

9）外部风险，网络和市场动荡，及潜在亏损：可能的分裂将影响到交易所、支付处理商和钱包服务商，如果发生永久分裂那么他们就要规划、准备和支持一个新的币种，如果不这样做，这些第三方团队会有潜在的亏损。此外，要求参与者在硬分叉前采取额外的预防措施保护钱包，并暴露出用户可能会失去资金，将造成网络动荡。避免网络混乱应该是协议升级的主要问题，不幸的是S2X可能会完全相反。最后，来自S2X的不确定往往对整个加密货币市场的资产价格造成负面影响。

10) Misleading miners: it seems that miners have been misled into signing to a promise that overwhelming agreement in the network would be achieved. But since this is clearly not the case, if miners do run btc1 core, they endanger their operations by mining a chain the majority of users will invalidate. A more prudent approach would have been to recommend miners to “execute a hardfork if the signs of consensus in the network are unequivocal”, but never “do hardfork at all costs”.

10）误导矿工：似乎矿工被误导去签署一个承诺，说网络上的压倒一切的协议将会实现。但显然不是，如果矿工们运行btc1 core，挖大多数用户弃用的链，那么将危及运营。更谨慎的做法是建议矿工们：“如果网络表现出已达成明确的共识，则硬分叉”，但不要“不惜一切代价硬分叉”。

11) Misleading statements by some proponents: unfortunately, companies we do admire and have business with have released misleading statements regarding S2X inadvertently withholding crucial information from its users about what is really at play in the network. Everyone is free to choose the software they want to run, but customers should be rightfully informed if its service provider is adopting an incompatible implementation and what the risks are.

11）一些支持者的误导性言论：不幸的是，一些我们钦佩和有生意往来的公司已经发布了关于S2X的误导性声明，关于其在网络中扮演的真正角色，无意中没有告知用户一些重要信息。每个人都可以自由选择他们想要运行的软件，但如果服务提供商采用不兼容的实现方式，应该正确地通知客户以及告知相关的风险。

We believe sooner or later upgrades to the protocol will necessitate a hardfork. With due planning and preparation the network can smoothly coordinate to effectuate such changes with minimal chances of chain split and disruption. That, however, requires time, education and testing.

我们相信迟早需要一个硬分叉来升级协议。通过适当的规划和准备，网络以最小的链分裂和中断的可能性来顺利适应这种变化。然而，这需要时间，教育和测试。

Governance in a free open-source software is a complex business and some parties become frustrated by the lack of agility or ability to upgrade the protocol. Roadmaps, promises, and compromises are innocuous in a decentralized consensus network where no entity or group of actors can unilaterally dictate and enforce rules at will. We are all part of consensus.

自由开源软件的治理是一项复杂的工程，由于缺乏升级协议的灵活性或能力，各方已然受挫。路线图、承诺和妥协在去中心化的共识网络中是无害的，没有任何实体或行动者可以单方面决定和执行规则。我们都是共识的一部分。

For all the reasons above, the Brazilian and Argentinian Bitcoin communities stand in opposition to SegWit2x. We consider any potential benefit arising from a hardfork as per the NYA is not worth the risks. Therefore, we urge its proponents to discontinue this endeavor and reengage the community towards a healthy and collaborative process for improving Bitcoin’s protocol.

综上所述，巴西和阿根廷的比特币社区反对SegWit2x。我们认为根据纽约协议的硬分叉产生的任何潜在收益不值得冒险。因此，我们敦促其提案者停止这一努力，重新启动社区，促进改善比特币协议的健康和协作进程。
