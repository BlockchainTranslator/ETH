Blockchains are a technology of tomorrow, not today.

区块链是一项明天的技术，而非今天的技术。

That is not an excuse to ignore them, however. On the contrary, the future to which blockchains belong is coming so fast that a failure to properly strategize and to consider the widest range of design possibilities could eventually prove fatal for many businesses.

然而，这并不是忽视它们的借口。与此相反，区块链的未来发展如此之快，以至于如果没有正确的战略并考虑最广泛的设计可能性，最终可能会对许多企业造成致命的影响。
This is especially so in supply-chain management, a field that deals with the plumbing of the global economy: how a good's production moves sequentially through the manufacturing processes of separately owned businesses before it is delivered to the end-user.

尤其是在供应链管理领域，这是一个打造全球经济管道的领域：一个产品交付给最终用户之前，生产过程如何通过各个单独的业务环节，有序地推进。

A combination of new technologies – artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, the internet of things, mobile money, digital identity and, most importantly, 3D printing – is poised to seriously disrupt these underlying processes. They'll make manufacturing more responsive and customizable to customer's orders – in effect, turning supply chains into demand chains. But this dynamism will only be realized if they also adopt the kind of decentralized trust mediation model promised by blockchains.

新技术的组合——人工智能、大数据、机器学习、物联网、移动货币、数字身份，最重要的是，3D打印——正准备彻底的颠覆供应链过程。他们将使制造业对客户的订单，响应更快，更可定制——实际上，将供应链变成需求链。但这只有采用区块链带来的分散式信任，才会实现。

Supply-chain managers are typically found only at big, downstream companies, such as Walmart. These experts have real influence in the management of many consumer brands.

供应链经理通常只在大型、下游的公司，如沃尔玛(Walmart)，才有。这些专家对许多消费品牌的管理，有着真正的影响。

Smaller upstream players occupying spots earlier on in the chain are outgunned by the bigger players and generally can’t influence the activities of others enough to warrant employing a supply-chain manager. Yet, ironically, improved chain transparency and visibility from better supply-chain management would help them gain bargaining power vis-à-vis the big guys.

较小的上游玩家在找供应链上占据早期的位置，但被更大的玩家所击败，通常因不能影响其他企业的活动，所以无法雇佣一个供应链经理。然而，具有讽刺意味的是，改善供应链的透明度和可预见性，将有助于他们与大块头讨价还价。

So, when we hear about supply chain managers giving thought to blockchain solutions to their problems, it's worth remembering where they are coming from: they represent large buyer companies and tend to view their supply chain proprietarily. They see it as an exclusive club over which they control access, one with a clearly defined, existing set of members.

因此，当我们听到供应链经理们考虑，通过区块链解决他们问题的时候，我们应该记住他们从哪里来：他们代表着大的买方公司，并且倾向于关注他们自己的供应链。他们把它看作是一个他们专有俱乐部，一个他们可以控制访问的，有明确定义的，有固定的成员的联盟。

It's a static vision, not a dynamic one, and it's marked by a power imbalance in their favor.

这是静态的，不是动态的，是带有他们自己的偏好的。

Static vision, static choices

静态眼界，静态的选择

From that perspective, it's understandable –in fact, appropriate – that many are asking why they should bother with the cat-herding challenge of getting their supply-chain partners to jointly create a complicated, costly, multi-node computing network to run a distributed blockchain ledger.

从这个角度来看，这是可以理解的——事实上，很多人都在问，为什么他们碰到极大的挑战，在让他们的供应链合作伙伴，共同创建一个复杂的、昂贵的多节点计算网络，运营一个分布式的区块链账本的时候。

Often they discover they can address many supply-chain information-management problems, including improving the tracking of inventory and work processes, with well-established database tools that already run internally on their company’s servers.

他们经常发现，他们已经可以解决许多供应链信息管理问题，包括改进对库存和工作流程，通过在公司服务器内部运行的完善的数据库。

As Gideon Greenspan, CEO of Coin Sciences, has warned, "If your requirements are fulfilled by today's relational databases, you’d be insane to use a blockchain."

正如，Coin Sciences CEO，吉迪恩•格林斯潘(Gideon Greenspan)，曾警告过的：“如果你的需求已经通过今天的关系数据库实现了，那么使用区块链就是疯狂的行为。”

Firms that operate in supply chains where power is more balanced, where middle-size firms have some clout and too much to lose by submitting information to the centralized control of the biggest player, might instead conclude that a blockchain is useful. A distributed, immutable ledger could help different stakeholders overcome their inherent mistrust of each other, which could boost efficiency and visibility along the chain.

对于运营供应链中各方力量平衡的公司，区块链更有作用。因为中型公司有一定的影响力，并且如果将信息提交给最大的玩家集中控制，他们就会损失太多。一个分布式的、不可变的账本，可以帮助不同的利益相关者，克服彼此之间的不信任感，从而提高供应链上的效率和可见性。

Yet here, too, the scope tends to be limited. Since the supply chain is viewed as a club with pre-existing, pre-approved members, chain managers have a hard time grasping why they would submit their transaction-sharing processes to a fully decentralized network and a permissionless blockchain such as bitcoin or ethereum. They'd much prefer to form a consortium and jointly validate the private distributed ledger.

然而，这里的作用范围也往往是有限的。由于供应链被视为一个事先存在的、事先认可成员的俱乐部，供应链经理很难理解为什么他们要把他们的交易分享过程提交给一个完全去中心化的和访问不受限制的区块链，比如比特币或以太坊。他们更倾向于组成一个联盟，并联合验证私有的分布式账本。

They see other advantages in private blockchains, too: the permissioned structure allows much more transaction capacity than public blockchains; upgrades can be easily agreed to and trivially implemented; identity, privacy and other natural concerns of businesses can be addressed in ways that public blockchains cannot.

他们也看到了私有区块链的其他优势：访问受限，可以使私有链比公有链更大的交易能力；更升级可以很容易地达成一致和实施；企业的身份、隐私和其他的企业关心的问题都可以得到解决，这些通过公有链是不能解决的。

But in an era of rapid technological change that poses an existential threat for legacy businesses, it's unwise to assume a static business environment. Many people know the Kodak story.

但在一个技术快速变化的时代，传统企业受到了生存的威胁，静态的看待商业环境是非常不明智的。很多人都知道柯达的故事。

There's a risk that a permissioned blockchain, based on a consortium managed by existing, pre-approved suppliers, would evolve into a rigid, gatekeeping entity. Members would be incentivized to limit access to outsiders with competing products and new ideas. And while that might protect the chain members’ margins for a while, it would ultimately render the whole chain less competitive.

有一种风险是，一个访问受限、由现有的、预先审批过的供应商组成的联盟，将演变成一个僵化的、封闭的团体。成员们将受到都引导，限制接触外界竞争性产品和新想法。虽然这可能会在一段时间内保护成员的利润率，但最终会使整个供应链竞争力下降。

It might not be a huge risk now, but, as mentioned, things are changing. Rapidly.

这可能现在还不是一个巨大的风险，但是，正如前面提到的，事情正在发生变化。迅速地！

The supply chains of the future will be much more dynamic, flexible and customer-responsive than those of the present. Geography and longstanding relationships will be less of issue. This suggests that supply chain managers should not only be looking at blockchains but also striving for the most open, permissionless model they can handle.

未来的供应链将比现在更有活力、更灵活、更能响应客户的需求。地理和长期存在关系，将不再是问题。这表明，供应链管理人员，不仅应该关注区块链，还应努力争取最开放、无访问现在的商业模式。

They might not need to adopt bitcoin or ethereum per se; I could even be persuaded that a permissioned network of validators might still preserve a decentralized, competitive landscape if the consortium’s governance rules steadfastly allowed any new supplier to write data to the ledger.

他们可能不需要采用比特币或以太坊。我甚至可以相信，如果该联盟的治理规则，可以允许任何新的供应商将数据写入账本，那么一个访问受限的验证网络，可能仍然会是去中心化的、竞争性的。

Either way, the bottom line is that openness and permissionlessness are vitally important ideals to strive for, precisely because they encourage competition and innovation.

不管怎样，开放和无访问控制是至关重要的努力方向，因为它们鼓励竞争和创新。

Decentralized trust

Taken together, new manufacturing technologies such as IoT and 3D-printing contain enormous decentralizing potential. By empowering people and businesses to do more with less, they reduce transaction costs, which means they can break down barriers to entry and challenge the economies of scale that have hitherto advantaged big, centralized companies.

综上所述，诸如物联网和3d打印这样的新制造技术具有巨大的去中心化潜力。通过让人们和企业用更少的钱做更多的事情，他们降低了交易成本，这意味着他们可以打破进入壁垒，并挑战那些大型、集中化的公司。

If we can prevent the data-gathering behemoths of the internet 2.0 era from monopolizing them, these tools should help level the playing field. They should open the door to to a wider array of potential producers in the global economy.

如果我们能阻止，互联网2.0时代的数据巨头垄断它们，那么区块链将会有助于公平竞争。他们会为全球经济中更广泛的潜在生产者敞开大门。

But to reach its optimal potential, that decentralized, more horizontal economic structure will also require a decentralized trust model. The cost of having a single company verify the trustworthiness of an ever-widening array of potential business partners will be too high for any supply chain to remain competitive.

但是要达到这样的目标，更扁平化化的经济结构需要一个去中心化的信任模型。对一个公司来说，验证一个潜在商业伙伴可信度的成本，非常高，如果要保证供应链的竞争力。

Let’s imagine a world in which 3D printing – known as additive manufacturing in the industrial world – is ubiquitous. Now imagine a German auto-parts producer receiving a request for quotes from an Argentine car assembler, a customer it has never previously dealt with, and for delivery in two days. The German company knows it’s highly likely that competing manufacturers in the U.S., Brazil, India and South Korea have also received offers. The only way to meet the order is to tap a hitherto untested 3D-printing company in Buenos Aires.

让我们想象一个世界，在这个世界里，3D打印——被称为工业世界的叠加制造——无处不在。现在想象一下，一家德国汽车零部件生产商收到了来自于阿根廷一家汽车组装公司的报价请求，这是一个从未处理过的客户，并且需要在两天内交付。这家德国公司知道，在美国、巴西、印度和韩国极有可能也也收到了报价。要完成这一订单，唯一的办法就是使用一个，在布宜诺斯艾利斯，迄今为止未经测试的3d打印公司。

How can it trust this supplier? The time and cost of applying current due diligence, credentialing and approval procedures to onboard this company into an approved list of suppliers would take too long and cost too much money. It would leave the German company outcompeted for the job.

它怎么能信任这个供应商？通过传统的尽职调查、认证和批准程序，把该公司列入批准的供应商名单，将花费太多时间和成本。这将使这家德国公司无法完成这张订单。

As supply chains start to function more like the demand chain of this scenario, trust dilemmas like this may force manufacturers to look to blockchain solutions.

随着供应链开始更像需求链，像这种场景中的，信任困境可能会迫使制造商寻求区块链解决方案。

There's a lot of work going into how to use blockchain-based input logs and unique identifiers to prove the veracity of data emanating from interconnected devices such as 3D printers. Applying a similar change-of-state log for alterations to software, blockchains could also assure users that the code in a particular file used to print the relevant part complies with the specifications as advertised, that it hasn’t been tampered with. Cryptographic proofs of the integrity of a 3D-printing process may well allow manufacturers to hire a supplier in minutes, whereas previously they could never do so without face-to-face meetings.

这里还有很多的工作要做，如何使用基于区块链的输入日志和唯一的标识符，来证明诸如3D打印机之类互联设备的数据真实性。如果应用类似状态变更的日志来修改软件，区块链还可以向用户保证，用于打印相关的文件代码和广告中的是一样，并没有被篡改。一个3d打印过程的完整加密证明，可以允许制造商在几分钟内雇佣一个供应商，而以前他们从来没有这样做过，不通过面对面的会议。

This kind of blockchain model could greatly speed up the onboarding process. But it would need to be based on permissionless, open access for new suppliers.

这种区块链模型，正在极大的加速进程中。但它需要建立在，对新供应商开放的、无访问许可的基础上。

The changes we're talking about are step up from the 1990s round of disruption and decentralization that came with the advent of the Internet and globalization. Those trends created a wider pool of potential suppliers, disintegrating decades-old supply chains.

我们所谈论的变化，是上世纪90年代开始的，随着互联网和全球化而出现的颠覆性和去中心化。这些趋势造就了更广泛的潜在供应商池子，瓦解了数十年来的供应链。

New IT technologies like 3D printing are an extension, or perhaps an acceleration, of the disruption unleashed then when the Internet decentralized the information-gathering process and removed barriers to communication. The next big step-function change will come from decentralizing the trust barrier.

像3D打印这样的新IT技术是这种颠覆的延伸，或者可能是加速，当互联网将信息收集过程去中心化、并消除沟通障碍时。下一个重大的功能变化，将来自于去中心化信任障碍的消除。

That's the prism through which the boldest, most innovative manufacturers should be viewing blockchains and their critical role in the global economy of the future.

这是一个棱镜，通过它，最大胆、最具创新力的制造商，可以看到区块链及其在未来全球经济中的关键作用。
